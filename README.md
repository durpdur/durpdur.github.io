My personal portfolio website (12/2023)

## Image asset considerations:
- Should probably use vector graphics as much as possible, as pngs are usually too large

## Message considerations
- For simplicity sake, just use mailto: and attach the from data to the mail service
- I probably set up a gmail SMTP at a later date, but need to look at how smtp interacts with gitignore
    - Probably will have some kind of documentation on it
